What is it?
-------------------------------------------------
Jabba "Framework" is a collection of utility/technical classes.

I found myself always copy/pasting some basic classes every time I start a new personal  project 
(and trust me, it happens a lot haha). This project is just a place to gather those classes, with an attempt
on modularity.
