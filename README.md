What is it?
-------------------------------------------------
Jabba "Framework" is a collection of utility/technical classes.

I found myself always copy/pasting some basic classes every time I start a new personal  project 
(and trust me, it happens a lot haha). This project is just a place to gather those classes, with an attempt
on modularity.

**DISCLAIMER**: This is more of a toy framework than a real framework. Use it at your own risks!

Latest javadoc available here: https://jchampemont.github.io/javadoc/jabba-persistence/master/

How to use?
-------------------------------------------------
The jar files are available on the Github [releases](https://github.com/jchampemont/jabba-framework/releases)
or on my Github [maven repository](https://github.com/jchampemont/maven-repository).

With my Github maven repository configured, you can depend on any Jabba subproject with the
following artifact coordinates:

- `groupId`: `com.jeanchampemont.jabba`
- `artifactId`: `jabba-subproject` (example: `jabba-persistence`)
- `version`: `0.1.0` (latest)
